  This example is based on the GD32M531R-EVAL-V1.2 board, it shows how to use RCU clock out function.
When program is running, user could press the USER key to select different clock output mode.
Demo has 5 clock output mode. Once the key is pressed, the next mode will be selected and
corresponding led will light. Debug information can be printed from COM by using UART. The
clock output pin is configured PF12.
  JP18 must be connected.
